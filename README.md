My submission for the Rock, Paper, Scissors project for the Odin Project.

I have commented out the code that I used to meet the initial requirement of writing a script that would play 5 rounds of Rock, Paper, Scissors. This submission is the additional work I put in to allow the same objective to be met by using webpage elements instead of the console.
